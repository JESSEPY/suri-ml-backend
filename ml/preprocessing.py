"""Feature preprocessing (spec section 7).

Continuous features are median-imputed with an explicit missingness indicator,
so the model learns "this was not measured" rather than silently trusting an
imputed guess — essential because each data source is missing different things.

Remarks are ordinal-encoded rather than one-hot because the bands are genuinely
ordered (LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH); one-hot would discard that ordering, which matters
for the Kernel Ridge half of the ensemble.
